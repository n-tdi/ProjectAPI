I learned about abstraction and Object Orientated Programming through C# and in the process, made some fun games! I really understood programming patterns and the Unity core engine which is very, very big. With my new understanding of C#, me being 12 at the time, obviously played the online video game called Roblox. There are things called DLLs which allow people to inject code into programs, Roblox being made with Lua was very easy to target with these types of injections. Thus with my C# knowledge, I was able to make a fully working roblox executor and script hub. After maintaining it for a few weeks and got bored, I decided to finally go back to my home game, Minecraft, and there would I really get to the heart of my development career.", 55);
