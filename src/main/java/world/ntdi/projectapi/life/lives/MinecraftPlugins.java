I loved making servers with redstone and command blocks, but soon realized that if I wanted to give my players a professional grade experience, I was going to have to step it up a notch. I went back into the Java field and learned about the Spigot API, which is an API for interacting with a Minecraft Server, allowing you to make mostly whatever you want. The Spigot API is how I learned some more advanced concepts in Java and even go into hosting my own JVM libraries! Yet, how am I to display off all these projects without a little frontend help?", 50);
